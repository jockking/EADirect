# Docker Compose Override Example
# Copy this file to docker-compose.override.yml for development customization
# docker-compose automatically merges this with docker-compose.yml

services:
  # Development backend with hot reload
  backend:
    volumes:
      # Mount source code for hot reload (uncomment for development)
      # - ./backend:/app
      # Don't override venv
      # - /app/venv
    environment:
      # Override environment variables for development
      - DEBUG=true
    # Use reload for development
    # command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

  # Expose postgres for local development tools
  postgres:
    ports:
      - "5433:5432"  # Map to different host port to avoid conflicts
